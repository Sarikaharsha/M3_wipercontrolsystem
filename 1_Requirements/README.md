SWOT Analysis:

Strength:       Provide a clean vison and comfortable driving to the driver.
Weakness:       Adding this mechanism to older vechiles is difficult.
Opportunities:  All vechicles can be made with this mechanism at low cost.
Threats:        Making the drivers aware of the requirement of this mechanism.
