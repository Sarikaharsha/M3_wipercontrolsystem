                                                                   WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM 
                                                                   
    The traditional wiper system however requires driver constant attention in adjusting the wiper speed. Traditional windshield wiper speed constantly varies according to time and vehicleâ€™s speed. Because the manual adjustment of the wiper distracts driver's attention, which may be a direct cause accidents.Wiper is an equipment used in vehicles to clean and wipe out water and dust particles from the wind screen. It is practically not possible for a driver to clean the windscreen while driving in rain. Hence there is a high necessary for a mechanism to do this job in a sigle click. Thus the objective of the project is to develop
a mechanism to clean the windscreen while the  vehicle is running. This project also aims to clean the wind screen at different speed respective to the rate of rainfall.Thus providing a clear vison to the driver for a safe driving.The project is developed using STM32 ARM based controller. A windscreen wiper or windshield wiper is a device used to remove rain and debris from a windscreen. Almost all motor vehicle, including trains, aircraft and watercraft, are equipped with such wipers, which are usually an essential requirement. A wiper generally consists of an arm, pivoting at one end and with a long rubber blade attached to the other.
